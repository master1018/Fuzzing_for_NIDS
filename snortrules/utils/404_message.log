漏洞编号：CVE-2019-13980 | 等级：中危 | 时间：2019-07-19 | 详情地址：http://cve.scap.org.cn/vuln/VH-CVE-2019-13980 | 漏洞简介：In Directus 7 API through 2.3.0, uploading of PHP files is blocked only when the Apache HTTP Server is used, leading to uploads/_/originals remote code execution with nginx.                    
漏洞编号：CVE-2019-12938 | 等级：低危 | 时间：2019-06-24 | 详情地址：http://cve.scap.org.cn/vuln/VH-CVE-2019-12938 | 漏洞简介：The Roundcube component of Analogic Poste.io 2.1.6 uses .htaccess to protect the logs/ folder, which is effective with the Apache HTTP Server but is ineffective with nginx. Attackers can read logs via the webmail/logs/sendmail URI.                    
漏洞编号：CVE-2019-9161 | 等级：高危 | 时间：2019-04-18 | 详情地址：http://cve.scap.org.cn/vuln/VH-CVE-2019-9161 | 漏洞简介：WAC on the Sangfor Sundray WLAN Controller version 3.7.4.2 and earlier has a Remote Code Execution issue allowing remote attackers to achieve full access to the system, because shell metacharacters in the nginx_webconsole.php Cookie header can be used to read an etc/config/wac/wns_cfg_admin_detail.xml file containing the admin password. (The password for root is the WebUI admin password concatenated with a static string.)                    
漏洞编号：CVE-2018-11747 | 等级：高危 | 时间：2019-03-21 | 详情地址：http://cve.scap.org.cn/vuln/VH-CVE-2018-11747 | 漏洞简介：Previously, Puppet Discovery was shipped with a default generated TLS certificate in the nginx container. In version 1.4.0, a unique certificate will be generated on installation or the user will be able to provide their own TLS certificate for ingress.                    
漏洞编号：F154836 | 等级：暂无数据 | 时间：2019-10-14 | 详情地址：http://cve.scap.org.cn/vuln/VH-F154836 | 漏洞简介：Debian Linux Security Advisory 4539-3 - The update for openssl released as DSA 4539-1 introduced a regression where AES-CBC-HMAC-SHA ciphers were not enabled. Updated openssl packages are now available to correct this issue.                    
漏洞编号：F154765 | 等级：暂无数据 | 时间：2019-10-08 | 详情地址：http://cve.scap.org.cn/vuln/VH-F154765 | 漏洞简介：Debian Linux Security Advisory 4539-2 - A change introduced in openssl 1.1.1d (which got released as DSA 4539-1) requires sandboxing features which are not available in Linux kernels before 3.19, resulting in OpenSSH rejecting connection attempts if running on an old kernel. This does not affect Linux kernels shipped in Debian oldstable/stable, but may affect buster systems which are running on an older kernel.                    
漏洞编号：CVE-2018-20997 | 等级：高危 | 时间：2019-08-26 | 详情地址：http://cve.scap.org.cn/vuln/VH-CVE-2018-20997 | 漏洞简介：An issue was discovered in the openssl crate before 0.10.9 for Rust. A use-after-free occurs in CMS Signing.                    
漏洞编号：CVE-2016-10931 | 等级：中危 | 时间：2019-08-26 | 详情地址：http://cve.scap.org.cn/vuln/VH-CVE-2016-10931 | 漏洞简介：An issue was discovered in the openssl crate before 0.9.0 for Rust. There is an SSL/TLS man-in-the-middle vulnerability because certificate verification is off by default and there is no API for hostname verification.                    
漏洞编号：CVE-2019-1552 | 等级：低危 | 时间：2019-07-30 | 详情地址：http://cve.scap.org.cn/vuln/VH-CVE-2019-1552 | 漏洞简介：OpenSSL has internal defaults for a directory tree where it can find a configuration file as well as certificates used for verification in TLS. This directory is most commonly referred to as OPENSSLDIR, and is configurable with the --prefix / --openssldir configuration options. For OpenSSL versions 1.1.0 and 1.1.1, the mingw configuration targets assume that resulting programs and libraries are installed in a Unix-like environment and the default prefix for program installation as well as for OPENSSLDIR should be &#39;/usr/local&#39;. However, mingw programs are Windows programs, and as such, find themselves looking at sub-directories of &#39;C:/usr/local&#39;, which may be world writable, which enables untrusted users to modify OpenSSL&#39;s default configuration, insert CA certificates, modify (or even replace) existing engine modules, etc. For OpenSSL 1.0.2, &#39;/usr/local/ssl&#39; is used as default for OPENSSLDIR on all Unix and Windows targets, including Visual C builds. However, some build...                    
漏洞编号：CVE-2019-5443 | 等级：低危 | 时间：2019-07-02 | 详情地址：http://cve.scap.org.cn/vuln/VH-CVE-2019-5443 | 漏洞简介：A non-privileged user or program can put code and a config file in a known non-privileged path (under C:/usr/local/) that will make curl &lt;= 7.65.1 automatically run the code (as an openssl &#34;engine&#34;) on invocation. If that curl is invoked by a privileged user it can do anything it wants.                    
漏洞编号：CVE-2019-12572 | 等级：高危 | 时间：2019-06-21 | 详情地址：http://cve.scap.org.cn/vuln/VH-CVE-2019-12572 | 漏洞简介：A vulnerability in the London Trust Media Private Internet Access (PIA) VPN Client 1.0.2 (build 02363) for Windows could allow an authenticated, local attacker to run arbitrary code with elevated privileges. On startup, the PIA Windows service (pia-service.exe) loads the OpenSSL library from %PROGRAMFILES%\Private Internet Access\libeay32.dll. This library attempts to load the C:\etc\ssl\openssl.cnf configuration file which does not exist. By default on Windows systems, authenticated users can create directories under C:\. A low privileged user can create a C:\etc\ssl\openssl.cnf configuration file to load a malicious OpenSSL engine library resulting in arbitrary code execution as SYSTEM when the service starts.                    
漏洞编号：F152639 | 等级：暂无数据 | 时间：2019-04-25 | 详情地址：http://cve.scap.org.cn/vuln/VH-F152639 | 漏洞简介：testssl.sh is a free command line tool which checks a server&#39;s service on any port for the support of TLS/SSL ciphers, protocols as well as recent cryptographic flaws, and much more. It is written in (pure) bash, makes only use of standard Unix utilities, openssl and last but not least bash sockets.
